- VAMAS-XPS/
    - Submodule of a second GitHub repository that can be used to parse the raw XPS data
- XPS_DATA/
    - 211123/211124/211206/211216/
        - folders containing various raw XPS data
    - CONFIGS/
        - config files to use with vamas-xps parser to parse raw XPS data. sample labels are contained within; data labeled with [letter][roman numeral] (e.g. Fii) is from the second wafer of ITO on silicon, while data labeled with ITOSA[number][letter][roman numeral] (e.g. ITOSA5ei) is from various ITO on glass slides from Sigma Aldrich
        - note that "spectra" give surface-level data which is not so useful due to surface contamination, while "depth" profiles give spectra taken in between argon ion milling through the sample
